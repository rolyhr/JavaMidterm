***ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: Data structure helps us organize, manage & store dta efficiently. We need it for the efficiency,
        re-usability, and invisibility.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching & Sorting.

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer: Data structure helps us organize, manage & store dta efficiently. We need it for the efficiency,
        re-usability, and invisibility.

What is an Array?
Answer: Array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single data type. The length
        of an array is established when the array is created & values are stays ordered.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: Array is basic container that holds fixed number of values which can be accessed by its index
        position. ArrayList is part of collection in java. ArrayList has set of methods to access
        elements and modify them.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer: LinkedList is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations
        and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. A LinkedList is a collection of
        objects known as a node where node consists of two parts, data and address. Array elements
        store in a contiguous memory location. Linked list elements are dependent on each other.

What is a Queue?
Answer: Queue is used to insert elements at the end of the queue(tail) and removes from the beginning
        of the queue(head). It follows FIFO concept.

What is a Stack (not Java memory - refers to data structure)?
Answer: Stack members within stack are accessed using LIFO (Last In, First Out). Holds elements of similar
        types. Values are ordered.

What are FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO is First In First Out
        LIFO is Last IN First Out

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O notation is a way to describe the speed or complexity of an algorithm.

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The best case to search an element from an array is O(n).

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The best case to search an element from an array is also O(n).

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: Tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and
        nodes are connected by edges.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer: Graph data structure consisting of data that is stored among many groups of edges(paths) and
        vertices (nodes), which are interconnected.

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: HashMap is non synchronized. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values. HashMap is Fast.
        Hashtable is synchronized. Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value. Hashtable is slow.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model
Answer: RDBMS = Array
        Network data model = Graph
        Hierarchical data model = Trees

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer: HashMap stores data in a key-value pair. It doesn't allow duplicate keys but allows duplicate
        values. If you want to store username & password, HashMap would be a perfect fit because you
        store username as Key & password as value.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is part of java.lang library. This except is thrown when an index
        of an array is either negative or greater than the size of an array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: Create a new array of the same length and copy each element, or you can use built-in methods in java.

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: DFS, stands for Depth First Search. BFS uses Queue to find the shortest path. DFS uses Stack to
        find the shortest path. BFS is better when target is closer to Source.

What is Recursion?
Answer: When a method calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every
        element are attached to its previous and next adjacent.
        In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.

Outline different sorting algorithms and their time complexities:
                    Best            Average             Worst
Selection Sort	    Ω(n^2)	        θ(n^2)	            O(n^2)
Bubble Sort	        Ω(n)	        θ(n^2)	            O(n^2)
Insertion Sort      Ω(n)	        θ(n^2)	            O(n^2)
Heap Sort	        Ω(n log(n))	    θ(n log(n))	        O(n log(n))
Quick Sort	        Ω(n log(n))	    θ(n log(n))	        O(n^2)
Merge Sort	        Ω(n log(n))	    θ(n log(n))	        O(n log(n))
Bucket Sort	        Ω(n+k)	        θ(n+k)	            O(n^2)
Radix Sort	        Ω(nk)	        θ(nk)	            O(nk)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a) In terms of Accessing elements:
  b) In terms of Inserting elements:
  c) In terms of Searching elements:
  d) In terms of Removing elements:
